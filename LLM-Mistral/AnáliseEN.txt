1. Based on the provided data, it appears that the 'MoneyPrinterTurbo' repository is using a GitHub Flow branching model. This is inferred from the description of the workflow where the author works directly on the 'dev' branch and merges it into the 'main' branch via pull requests. This model allows for continuous integration and delivery, while also enabling the team to release stable versions to production when they are ready.

2. The release strategy for 'MoneyPrinterTurbo' seems to be feature-based. This is inferred from the fact that releases do not follow a fixed schedule and are created when there are new features or critical bug fixes accumulated in the 'main' branch. This strategy allows the team to release new versions whenever they have significant changes to deliver to their users.

Evidence:
- GitHub Flow branching model: The author works on the 'dev' branch and merges it into 'main' via pull requests.
- Feature-based release strategy: Releases are created when there are new features or critical bug fixes accumulated in the 'main' branch.
